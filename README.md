# Bike-Share-project
Practice project for a data analytics certification course.
## Dude Where's my Bike?

The setting: I have been tasked by the fictional copany "Cyclistic" to 
investigate the difference between how members(customers with annual 
subcriptons) and casual riders (customers who purchase single use or day passes) 
are utilizing an e-bike service in Chicago. This data will be used (fictionally) 
to help the marketing team develop new strategies to convert casual riders into 
members.  

The data: The data used will be the previous 12 months of bike-share data
collected by the company. This data contains information about ride times, 
member types, trip dates, bike type and station location information. This data
does not include any personal information, so I will not be able to compare the 
number of trips in a period by unique customers within member types.  

### Setting up the data in R Studio

I decided to use R because it included the organizing, cleaning and manipulation
functionality that I want for this project, that I would use multiple other 
applications for otherwise.
